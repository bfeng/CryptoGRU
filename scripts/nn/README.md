NN-Compress
-----------

Simple scripts to compress and quantize NN models. These are based on this [repo](https://github.com/aaron-xichen/pytorch-playground).

The main additions are: 
- Conversion to fixed point integer representation. 
- Support for Square Non-Linearities
- Support for existing "Secure" networks implementations
